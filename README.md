Webpack Lazy Loading

https://webpack.js.org/guides/lazy-loading/

Lazy, or "on demand", loading is a great way to optimize your site or application. This practice essentially involves splitting your code at logical breakpoints, and then loading it once the user has done something that requires, or will require, a new block of code. This speeds up the initial load of the application and lightens its overall weight as some blocks may never even be loaded.

* Frameworks
Many frameworks and libraries have their own recommendations on how this should be accomplished within their methodologies. Here are a few examples:
